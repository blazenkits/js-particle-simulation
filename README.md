# Powder simulation in Javascript

Client-side particle simulation in JS with oversimplified physics.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Inspired by The Powder Toy.

- Simulation made in vanilla JS

- Custom properties and physics for particles, defined in `particledata.js`

- Particle Interactions, pressure, etc.

Example: https://blazenkits.github.io/js-particle-simulation/

(simulates max 20000 particles)
